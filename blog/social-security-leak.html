    <h1>Social Security Numbers Leak: The 2024 National Public Data Breach Overview</h1>
    <div><p>The breach of the National Public Data, from December 2023 through summer 2024, has resulted in one of the largest data breaches in history. It is reported that around 2.9 billion records were compromised, affecting individuals living in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom. It was further revealed that this leak comprised sensitive personal information, such as Social Security numbers, names, dates of birth, and addresses. This breach was orchestrated by the hacking group "USDoD," which first tried to auction the stolen data on the dark web before making it free to access.</p>

<h2>How and How to Prevent</h2>
<p>This breach was the result of a hacking attack against vulnerabilities in the way NPD stored data. The attackers probably stole access credentials via phishing, and then used SQL injection to break into the database, extracting enormous volumes of data. Preventative measures that could have mitigated the breach include:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Enhanced Database Security:</strong> Regular patching of vulnerabilities, robust encryption, and secure configurations.</li>
  <li><strong>Network Segmentation:</strong> Sensitive information should be segmented away from other systems to reduce access points.</li>
  <li><strong>Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):</strong> Layer up security to protect access to sensitive data.</li>
  <li><strong>Routine Security Audits:</strong> Proactively pinpoint and address vulnerabilities.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Data Specifics</h2>
<p>The breach exposed:</p>
<ul>
  <li>SSNs</li>
  <li>Full names</li>
  <li>Dates of birth</li>
  <li>Home addresses</li>
  <li>Phone numbers</li>
</ul>
<p>These details are super sensitive personal information which could be easily misused in times of identity theft and financial fraud in general.</p>

<h2>Data Privacy / Security / Storage Concern</h2>
<p>The leak of Social Security numbers and other personal data opens individuals to severe identity theft, financial fraud, and scams. This is information hackers can use to create fraudulent credit accounts, commit tax refund theft, and conduct phishing attacks against individuals. The hacking group publicized the data in this case, increasing the potential risks. Already, there have been some reports that this data has been used for identity fraud and fake loan applications.</p>
